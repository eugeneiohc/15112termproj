## readme.txt for Eugene Choi, 15-112 Term Project Fall 2017


## Usage (How to run)
# These files are to simply run a game by running the finalpygame.py file as python3. (Not python2) Verify that folders: “startImages” and “sounds” are in the main folder as well as scoreboard.txt, which has the high scores stored.


## Basic Explanation
# The user will get to choose different mods/options to make the gameplay easier or harder, and these correspond to changes in the score multiplier (base 100 increase per frame), so that the user will be rewarded with higher scores from trying harder difficulties.

# The game’s controls are quite simple, W being jump, A and D, being lane switches, and the arrow keys left/right, are for turning into lanes (similar to temple run).

# The user does their best to dodge spikes with W, A, D and turn into other lanes in time (not turning into a lane results in instant death).

# The user tries to get as far as s/he can and can choose to submit a score in the end to see if it gets the top 10 scorers recorded in an external text file.
